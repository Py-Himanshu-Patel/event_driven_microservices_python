# Event Driven Microservices
Event driven microservice architecture - Python Flask Docker RabbitMQ React

## Commands
```bash
# install packages in pipenv using pipenv instead of pip
pipenv install django

# make requirements.txt from Pipfile
pipenv run pip freeze > requirements.txt

# to check if compose file is made correctly 
docker-compose config

# to start containers from docker compose
docker-compose up

# start container in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# to stop containers from docker compose
docker-compose down
```

## Results

- Output after starting containers from docker compose 
	```bash
	((event_driven_microservices_python) )  $ docker ps
	CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES
	8e3d76363096   admin_backend   "python manage.py ruâ€¦"   11 minutes ago   Up 11 minutes   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp, :::8000->8000/tcp   admin_backend_1
	```
	If it's not a detached terminal then the containers will come down to halt as soon we close the terminal with `docker-compose up` command. 
	We can access the django homepage at `localhost:8000`

- If we choose latest mysql version in docker compose then we can directly connect with mysql running inside container from localhost.
	```bash
	mysql -uroot -proot -P33066 -h 127.0.0.1
	```
	another way is to enter into container and use the regular command to connect to mysql.
	```
	 $ docker exec -it admin_db_1 bash
	root@22e70d1c7ab5:/# mysql -u'root' -p'root'
	```

- If a file is created in docker container then it is assigned o docker_user but we can change it's ownership in host.
